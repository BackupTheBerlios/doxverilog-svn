- I've modified doxygen's c-preprocessor for verilog code constructs. Code fragments like
 
  `ifdef xxx
   .....
  `elsif yyy
   .....
   `endif

 shouldn't cause an error if xxx or yyy is defined

  The only limitation is for code  like :

   `endif if (i_clk_en) begin // not allowed 


Code between macros which are not defined is 'greyed out.


#ifdef LOW_FRQ // not defined
 `define FRQ 10000 // coloured grey
#endif

Changes

      top_module
           sub_module_1
                sub_sub_module..

Doxverilog Release 2.4.1

fixed bug some bugs [016597] and improved the preprocessor

- now `define constructs like

  `define TASK task multTask()\
      begin\
        .....\
        .....\
     endtask 

   are now supported

note: if you make the patch under LINUX

patching file winbuild/Doxygen.vcproj
 Hunk #1 FAILED at 1.
   ....
 occurs

 I don't know the cause of this error.However, the file is unimportant under LINUX and 
 the compilation should be successful.
